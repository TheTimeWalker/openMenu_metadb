# Instructions

## Notes
- USA and PAL are considered complete and should not require updates
- All Homebrew belongs in `meta_hb_in`, yes even commercial discs
- All things that aren't homebrew and aren't retail belong in `meta_ex_in`. This includes things like prototypes, demo discs, propeller arena, etc...

## How to add metadata for a particular disc
- Create a `txt` file in the appropriate folder with the name being the serial number of the disc.
    - e.g. `HB_IAN_DOOM.txt` for Ian Michael's doom port
- **Note:** the filename should be the Serial used in the IP.BIN of the disc image.
    - If no proper serial exists, e.g. `BOOTDREAMS` then feel free to make up an ID similar to `HB_IAN_DOOM`
    - Created ID's will be honored when making your openMenu gdi from [GDMENUCardManager](https://github.com/mrneo240/GDMENUCardManager/releases/) if you add `serial.txt` with the serial to the disc image folder

## What to write in a metadata file
### Example for `Rayman 2: The Great Escape` (`17707N.txt`)
